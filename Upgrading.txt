UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

This file contains instructions for upgrading your FLOW3 1.0 installation
to FLOW3 1.1.

PASSWORD HASHING
----------------

The hashing strategy for password went from salted MD5 over PBKDF2 to Bcrypt.
Plus it is now possible to use a mix of password hashing strategies, as the
used strategy is stored in the credentialsSource of an Account.

That means: make sure your default strategy setting matches the used strategy
for any accounts created before the related changes:

TYPO3:
  FLOW3:

      cryptography:
        hashingStrategies:
          default: bcrypt

If your credentials look like …, you have the … strategy:
   7kP/laYDXxQ=,iMoNTRTcbY01Q9LSeAaoxV9hq … QEmHm3ottU1yJdw==
      -> PBKDF2
   $2a$14$2zNPS6TfbMPCdnxuRlheu.2kZAJ … H3DaYwqqIeAgPzN6kTS
      -> BCrypt

      -> salted MD5

YAML SYNTAX
-----------

The YAML parser has been updated and now behaves different (albeit more correct).

 * Boolean values must no longer be written as y, yes, n, no but as TRUE and
   FALSE instead.
 * When using backslashes in strings, those are now handled as escape characters
   inside double quotes. So if you write class names, better wrap them in single
   quotes.
